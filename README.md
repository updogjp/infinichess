# Infinichess

A massively multiplayer infinite chess game where players control their own king pieces on an endless, persistent chessboard.

## Overview

Infinichess is a unique take on chess that combines traditional chess mechanics with massively multiplayer gameplay on an infinite world. Each player controls a single king, chooses their name and color, and can capture neutral pieces to build their own army. The world persists between server restarts, and players can claim territory for strategic advantages.

## Key Features

- **Infinite World**: No boundaries - play on an endless chessboard
- **Persistent State**: World saves to disk and survives server restarts
- **Player Customization**: Choose your name and color
- **Real-time Chat**: Floating chat bubbles above player kings
- **Massively Multiplayer**: Support for 100+ concurrent players

## Project History

**Infinichess** is a fork of **[Xess](https://github.com/...) / 10kchess**, originally created by [original author].

### Differences from Original

| Feature | Original (Xess) | Infinichess |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Board Size | 64x64 fixed | Infinite world |
| World Persistence | None | Saves to disk |
| Player Names | Auto-generated | Player-chosen |
| Player Colors | Auto-generated | Player-selected |
| Chat Display | Sidebar only | Floating bubbles + sidebar |
| Broadcasting | All players | Viewport-based |

### Why Fork?

The original Xess was an excellent proof-of-concept for massively multiplayer chess, but was limited by its fixed 64x64 board. Infinichess extends this concept to a truly infinite world with persistence and better player customization.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start server
npm start

# Open browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Development Mode

The server auto-detects local development. To bypass captcha for testing:
1. Edit `server/index.js` line ~9: Set a test captcha key or
2. Set `ws.verified = true` temporarily in the connection handler

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- **Backend**: Node.js with uWebSockets.js
- **Protocol**: Binary WebSocket messages (Uint16Array)
- **Storage**: Binary files for world persistence

### Key Components

1. **Spatial Hash**: Efficient infinite world storage
2. **Viewport Broadcasting**: Only send updates to visible players
3. **Procedural Generation**: Deterministic neutral piece spawning
4. **Persistence**: Auto-save world state every 60 seconds

## Network Protocol

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed protocol documentation.

### Magic Numbers

| Code | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 55551 | Player info (name + color) |
| 55552 | Camera position update |
| 55553 | Viewport sync |
| 55554 | Move piece |
| 55555 | Set square |
| 47095 | Chat message |
| 48027 | Leaderboard |
| 64535 | Neutralize team (player disconnect) |

## Game Mechanics

### Infinite World
- 64x64 chunks loaded on-demand
- Procedural neutral piece generation (0.2% chance per square)
- Players spawn randomly within 50,000 squares of origin
- Kings cannot spawn within 4 squares of other kings

### Persistence
- World saves every 60 seconds
- Saves on graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- Neutral pieces persist between restarts
- Player metadata (names, colors, kills) persisted
- Auto-loads on server startup

### Piece Types
| ID | Piece | Movement |
|----|-------|----------|
| 0 | Empty | - |
| 1 | Pawn | Orthogonal 1, diagonal capture |
| 2 | Knight | L-shape |
| 3 | Bishop | Diagonal |
| 4 | Rook | Orthogonal |
| 5 | Queen | Any direction |
| 6 | King | Any direction 1 square |

### Combat
- Move cooldown: 1.5 seconds
- Capture enemy kings to eliminate players
- Capture neutral pieces to add to your army
- Respawn time: 5 seconds
